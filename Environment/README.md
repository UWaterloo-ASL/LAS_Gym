# Environment class
This folder contains **Environment** classes. In our design, Environment is actually internal environment. All sensory data will be sent to learning agent from this interface, while all action command generated by learning agent will be sent to actuators through this interface too.

The public interfaces follow the Env class in OpenAi Gym.

To create a scene of living architecture environment:
1. Put the LAS_Gym\LAS-Scenes\las_scene_models\LAS_Model folder in your VREP model folder.  For example: C:\Program Files\V-REP3\V-REP_PRO_EDU\models\LAS_Model
2. Open VREP and load LAS_Gym\LAS-Scenes\livingArchitecture_load_model_test.ttt  This file has one copy of all LAS Models inside. This is to make sure that the models added later has correct suffix (#num). 
2. Run load_sculpture.py. This will read coordinates of actuators from output.csv file and set it in the scene.
4. Delete the models without suffix ï¼ˆ#num) and save the scene as new scene
